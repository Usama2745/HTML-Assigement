    <P>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-
        profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan. Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and 
        Zia Khan to help promote educatio, research and business opportunities in emerging tech
        feilds like

    <li>Internat Of Things</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><font face="forte">Cloud Native Computing:</h3></font>
    <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing </b> program of PIAIC takes the students to program in open source
    technologies like,<em><b>linux, Docoker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Note.js, React and React Native</b></em>
while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software 
development techniques on cloud platform like AWS.</p>
<h3><font face="forte">Artificial Intelligence:</h3></font>
<p>The <b>artificial Intelligence</b> progrm of PIAIC takes the student throug the foundation of the AI 
tecnology, via teaching programming in open soure languages like <b><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
    Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,
</em></b>
 and teaching deploying practical AI solutions are use cases, and
ending with real-life example of modren day AI in practice.</p>

<h3><font face="forte">Blockchain:</h3></font>
<p>
    The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchain like <em><b>Ethereum
        and Hyperledger (Fabric),
    </b></em>
    and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on 
    frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
    (DApps), frameworks like Wep3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-servie (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token. 
</p>

<h2> <font face="forte">Internat of Things:</h2></font>
<p>The <b>Internat of things</b> program indroduces the students to open source development 
tecnologies like <em><b>Rust, Embedded Rust, WepAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
     and Kubernetes
</b></em> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for lot Edge, loT
Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
